 abstract = {Publisher Summary

This chapter presents theory, applications, and computational methods for Markov Decision Processes (MDP's). MDP's are a class of stochastic sequential decision processes in which the cost and transition functions depend only on the current state of the system and the current action. These models have been applied in a wide range of subject areas, most notably in queueing and inventory control. A sequential decision process is a model for dynamic system under the control of a decision maker. Sequential decision processes are classified according to the times (epochs) at which decisions are made, the length of the decision making horizon, the mathematical properties of the state and action spaces, and the optimality criteria. The focus of this chapter is problems in which decisions are made periodically at discrete time points. The state and action sets are either finite, countable, compact or Borel; their characteristics determine the form of the reward and transition probability functions. The optimality criteria considered in the chapter include finite and infinite horizon expected total reward, infinite horizon expected total discounted reward, and average expected reward. The main objectives in analyzing sequential decision processes in general and MDP's in particular include (1) providing an optimality equation that characterizes the supremal value of the objective function, (2) characterizing the form of an optimal policy if it exists, (3) developing efficient computational procedures for finding policies thatare optimal or close to optimal. The optimality or Bellman equation is the basic entity in MDP theory and almost all existence, characterization, and computational results are based on its analysis.},

 abstract = {Pre-training has shown success in different areas of machine learning, such as Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and medical imaging. However, it has not been fully explored for clinical data analysis. An immense amount of clinical records are recorded, but still, data and labels can be scarce for data collected in small hospitals or dealing with rare diseases. In such scenarios, pre-training on a larger set of unlabelled clinical data could improve performance. In this paper, we propose novel unsupervised pre-training techniques designed for heterogeneous, multi-modal clinical data for patient outcome prediction inspired by masked language modeling (MLM), by leveraging graph deep learning over population graphs. To this end, we further propose a graph-transformer-based network, designed to handle heterogeneous clinical data. By combining masking-based pre-training with a transformer-based network, we translate the success of masking-based pre-training in other domains to heterogeneous clinical data. We show the benefit of our pre-training method in a self-supervised and a transfer learning setting, utilizing three medical datasets TADPOLE, MIMIC-III, and a Sepsis Prediction Dataset. We find that our proposed pre-training methods help in modeling the data at a patient and population level and improve performance in different fine-tuning tasks on all datasets.},

 abstract = {In image-to-image translation, each patch in the output should reflect the content of the corresponding patch in the input, independent of domain. We propose a straightforward method for doing so -- maximizing mutual information between the two, using a framework based on contrastive learning. The method encourages two elements (corresponding patches) to map to a similar point in a learned feature space, relative to other elements (other patches) in the dataset, referred to as negatives. We explore several critical design choices for making contrastive learning effective in the image synthesis setting. Notably, we use a multilayer, patch-based approach, rather than operate on entire images. Furthermore, we draw negatives from within the input image itself, rather than from the rest of the dataset. We demonstrate that our framework enables one-sided translation in the unpaired image-to-image translation setting, while improving quality and reducing training time. In addition, our method can even be extended to the training setting where each {\textquotedbl}domain{\textquotedbl} is only a single image.},

@article{Padua.1999,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To assess the clinical and neurophysiologic dissociation often observed in clinical practice, and to improve patient evaluation for diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

METHODS

The Italian CTS Study Group studied 1,123 idiopathic CTS hands with multiple measurements-clinical, neurophysiologic, and patient-oriented-of CTS.

RESULTS

Clinical and neurophysiologic relationships were very strong when the clinical picture was evaluated by the hand functional measurements, with an exponential increase in functional impairment as the classification of neurophysiologic severity progressed. Conversely, symptoms and pain did not increase as the classification of neurophysiologic severity progressed: 1) A large part of the CTS population complained of severe symptoms, although minimal functional impairment and minimal or no electrophysiologic abnormalities were observed; and 2) symptoms improved in the patients with more severe neurophysiologic and clinical examination scenarios.

CONCLUSIONS

Multiperspective and multimeasurement assessment, even when using a validated patient-oriented tool, provided interesting information that confirmed and clarified the clinical neurophysiologic dissociation often observed in carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients. Furthermore, CTS appeared to be an ideal model for evaluating the importance of patient-oriented measurement.},

 abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome is the most common peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome worldwide. The clinical symptoms and physical examination findings in patients with this syndrome are recognised widely and various treatments exist, including non-surgical and surgical options. Despite these advantages, there is a paucity of evidence about the best approaches for assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome and to guide treatment decisions. More objective methods for assessment, including electrodiagnostic testing and nerve imaging, provide additional information about the extent of axonal involvement and structural change, but their exact benefit to patients is unknown. Although the best means of integrating clinical, functional, and anatomical information for selecting treatment choices has not yet been identified, patients can be diagnosed quickly and respond well to treatment. The high prevalence of carpal tunnel syndrome, its effects on quality of life, and the cost that disease burden generates to health systems make it important to identify the research priorities that will be resolved in clinical trials.},

@article{Lindenroth.2020,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

In this work we address limitations in state-of-the-art ultrasound robots by designing and integrating a novel soft robotic system for ultrasound imaging. It employs the inherent qualities of soft fluidic actuators to establish safe, adaptable interaction between ultrasound probe and patient.

METHODS

We acquire clinical data to determine the movement ranges and force levels required in prenatal foetal ultrasound imaging and design the soft robotic end-effector accordingly. We verify its mechanical characteristics, derive and validate a kinetostatic model and demonstrate controllability and imaging capabilities on an ultrasound phantom.

RESULTS

The soft robot exhibits the desired stiffness characteristics and is able to reach 100{\%} of the required workspace when no external force is present, and 95{\%} of the workspace when considering its compliance. The model can accurately predict the end-effector pose with a mean error of 1.18$\pm$0.29~mm in position and 0.92$\pm$0.47° in orientation. The derived controller is, with an average position error of 0.39~mm, able to track a target pose efficiently without and with externally applied loads. Ultrasound images acquired with the system are of equally good quality compared to a manual sonographer scan.

CONCLUSION

The system is able to withstand loads commonly applied during foetal ultrasound scans and remains controllable with a motion range similar to manual scanning.

SIGNIFICANCE

The proposed soft robot presents a safe, cost-effective solution to offloading sonographers in day-to-day scanning routines. The design and modelling paradigms are greatly generalizable and particularly suitable for designing soft robots for physical interaction tasks.},

@article{Lowekamp.2013,
 abstract = {SimpleITK is a new interface to the Insight Segmentation and Registration Toolkit (ITK) designed to facilitate rapid prototyping, education and scientific activities via high level programming languages. ITK is a templated C++ library of image processing algorithms and frameworks for biomedical and other applications, and it was designed to be generic, flexible and extensible. Initially, ITK provided a direct wrapping interface to languages such as Python and Tcl through the WrapITK system. Unlike WrapITK, which exposed ITK's complex templated interface, SimpleITK was designed to provide an easy to use and simplified interface to ITK's algorithms. It includes procedural methods, hides ITK's demand driven pipeline, and provides a template-less layer. Also SimpleITK provides practical conveniences such as binary distribution packages and overloaded operators. Our user-friendly design goals dictated a departure from the direct interface wrapping approach of WrapITK, toward a new facade class structure that only exposes the required functionality, hiding ITK's extensive template use. Internally SimpleITK utilizes a manual description of each filter with code-generation and advanced C++ meta-programming to provide the higher-level interface, bringing the capabilities of ITK to a wider audience.

Clinical assessment is used for initial diagnosis and nerve conduction (NC) studies are currently the principal test used to confirm the diagnosis. Sensitivity of NC studies is {\textgreater}85{\%} and specificity is {\textgreater}95{\%}. There is now good evidence that US can be used as an alternative to NC studies to diagnose CTS. US can assess the anatomy of the median nerve and also identify pathology of the surrounding structures that may compress the nerve. Median nerve enlargement (cross-sectional area $\geq$10 mm(2) at the level of the pisiform bone or tunnel inlet) is the most commonly used parameter to diagnose CTS on US, and sensitivity has been reported to be as high as 97.9{\%} using this parameter. US may also be used to guide therapeutic corticosteroid injection into the carpal tunnel--thus avoiding median nerve injury--and to objectively monitor the response to treatment. There is now sufficient evidence to propose a new paradigm for the diagnosis of CTS that incorporates US. US is proposed as the initial diagnostic test in CTS based on similar sensitivity and specificity to NC studies but higher patient acceptability, lower cost and additional capability to assess carpal tunnel anatomy and guide injection.},

@article{Mnih.2015,
 abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

@article{Singh.1996,
 abstract = {The eligibility trace is one of the basic mechanisms used in reinforcement learning to handle delayed reward. In this paper we introduce a new kind of eligibility trace, the replacing trace, analyze it theoretically, and show that it results in faster, more reliable learning than the conventional trace. Both kinds of trace assign credit to prior events according to how recently they occurred, but only the conventional trace gives greater credit to repeated events. Our analysis is for conventional and replace-trace versions of the offline TD(1) algorithm applied to undiscounted absorbing Markov chains. First, we show that these methods converge under repeated presentations of the training set to the same predictions as two well known Monte Carlo methods. We then analyze the relative efficiency of the two Monte Carlo methods. We show that the method corresponding to conventional TD is biased, whereas the method corresponding to replace-trace TD is unbiased. In addition, we show that the method corresponding to replacing traces is closely related to the maximum likelihood solution for these tasks, and that its mean squared error is always lower in the long run. Computational results confirm these analyses and show that they are applicable more generally. In particular, we show that replacing traces significantly improve performance and reduce parameter sensitivity on the {\textquotedbl}Mountain-Car{\textquotedbl} task, a full reinforcement-learning problem with a continuous state space, when using a feature-based function approximator.},

@article{Yang.2021,
 abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome is one of the common peripheral neuropathies. For magnetic resonance imaging, segmentation of the carpal tunnel and its contents, including flexor tendons and the median nerve for magnetic resonance images is an important issue. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, which was modified by the original DeepLabv3 + model to segment three primary structures of the carpal tunnel: the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve. To extract important feature maps for segmentation of the carpal tunnel, flexor tendon, and median nerve, the proposed CNN model termed modified DeepLabv3 + uses DenseNet-121 as a backbone and adds dilated convolution to the original spatial pyramid pooling module. A MaskTrack method was used to refine the segmented results generated by modified DeepLabv3 + , which have a small and blurred appearance. For evaluation of the segmentation results, the average Dice similarity coefficients (ADSC) were used as the performance index. Sixteen MR images corresponding to different subjects were obtained from the National Cheng Kung University Hospital. Our proposed modified DeepLabv3 + generated the following ADSCs: 0.928 for carpal tunnel, 0.872 for flexor tendons and 0.785 for the median nerve. The ADSC value of 0.8053 generated the MaskTrack that 0.22 ADSC measure were improved for measuring the median nerve. The experimental results showed that the proposed modified DeepLabv3 + model can promote segmentations of the carpal tunnel and its contents. The results are superior to the results generated by original DeepLabv3 + . Additionally, MaskTrack can also effectively refine median nerve segmentations.},

 abstract = {There is an emerging trend to employ dynamic sonography in the diagnosis of entrapment neuropathy, which exhibits aberrant spatiotemporal characteristics of the entrapped nerve when adjacent tissues move. However, the manual tracking of the entrapped nerve in consecutive images demands tons of human labors and impedes its popularity clinically. Here we evaluated the performance of automated median nerve segmentation in dynamic sonography using a variety of deep learning models pretrained with ImageNet, including DeepLabV3+, U-Net, FPN, and Mask-R-CNN. Dynamic ultrasound images of the median nerve at across wrist level were acquired from 52 subjects diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome when they moved their fingers. The videos of 16 subjects exhibiting diverse appearance and that of the remaining 36 subjects were used for model test and training, respectively. The centroid, circularity, perimeter, and cross section area of the median nerve in individual frame were automatically determined from the inferred nerve. The model performance was evaluated by the score of intersection over union (IoU) between the annotated and model-predicted data. We found that both DeepLabV3+ and Mask R-CNN predicted median nerve the best with averaged IOU scores close to 0.83, which indicates the feasibility of automated median nerve segmentation in dynamic sonography using deep learning.},

@article{Smerilli.2022,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Deep learning applied to ultrasound (US) can provide a feedback to the sonographer about the correct identification of scanned tissues and allows for faster and standardized measurements. The most frequently adopted parameter for US diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome is the increasing of the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the median nerve. Our aim was to develop a deep learning algorithm, relying on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for the localization and segmentation of the median nerve and the automatic measurement of its CSA on US images acquired at the proximal inlet of the carpal tunnel.

METHODS

Consecutive patients with rheumatic and musculoskeletal disorders were recruited. Transverse US images were acquired at the carpal tunnel inlet, and the CSA was manually measured. Anatomical variants were registered. The dataset consisted of 246 images (157 for training, 40 for validation, and 49 for testing) from 103 patients each associated with manual annotations of the nerve boundary. A Mask R-CNN, state-of-the-art CNN for image semantic segmentation, was trained on this dataset to accurately localize and segment the median nerve section. To evaluate the performances on the testing set, precision (Prec), recall (Rec), mean average precision (mAP), and Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) were computed. A sub-analysis excluding anatomical variants was performed. The CSA was automatically measured by the algorithm.

RESULTS

The algorithm correctly identified the median nerve in 41/49 images (83.7{\%}) and in 41/43 images (95.3{\%}) excluding anatomical variants. The following metrics were obtained (with and without anatomical variants, respectively): Prec 0.86 $\pm$ 0.33 and 0.96 $\pm$ 0.18, Rec 0.88 $\pm$ 0.33 and 0.98 $\pm$ 0.15, mAP 0.88 $\pm$ 0.33 and 0.98 $\pm$ 0.15, and DSC 0.86 $\pm$ 0.19 and 0.88 $\pm$ 0.19. The agreement between the algorithm and the sonographer CSA measurements was excellent [ICC 0.97 (0.94-0.98)].

CONCLUSIONS

The developed algorithm has shown excellent performances, especially if excluding anatomical variants. Future research should aim at expanding the US image dataset including a wider spectrum of normal anatomy and pathology. This deep learning approach has shown very high potentiality for a fully automatic support for US assessment of carpal tunnel syndrome.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise to improve healthcare over the next decades. Specifically, AI systems leveraging multiple data sources and input modalities are poised to become a viable method to deliver more accurate results and deployable pipelines across a wide range of applications. In this work, we propose and evaluate a unified Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework to facilitate the generation and testing of AI systems that leverage multimodal inputs. Our approach uses generalizable data pre-processing and machine learning modeling stages that can be readily adapted for research and deployment in healthcare environments. We evaluate our HAIM framework by training and characterizing 14,324 independent models based on HAIM-MIMIC-MM, a multimodal clinical database (N = 34,537 samples) containing 7279 unique hospitalizations and 6485 patients, spanning all possible input combinations of 4 data modalities (i.e., tabular, time-series, text, and images), 11 unique data sources and 12 predictive tasks. We show that this framework can consistently and robustly produce models that outperform similar single-source approaches across various healthcare demonstrations (by 6-33{\%}), including 10 distinct chest pathology diagnoses, along with length-of-stay and 48 h mortality predictions. We also quantify the contribution of each modality and data source using Shapley values, which demonstrates the heterogeneity in data modality importance and the necessity of multimodal inputs across different healthcare-relevant tasks. The generalizable properties and flexibility of our Holistic AI in Medicine (HAIM) framework could offer a promising pathway for future multimodal predictive systems in clinical and operational healthcare settings.},

Whether there is somatotopic organization within these fascicles has long been of interest, the subject of many investigations, and somewhat controversial. Evidence from diverse sources now points to important somatotopic clustering of nerve fibers within most of the length of the nerve. Information is lacking regarding proximal segments, particularly the plexus and spinal nerve root levels. As a result of this somatotopic arrangement, partial focal nerve lesions can produce restricted clinical deficits that defy the classic rules of localization. Examples of such restricted nerve lesions are provided in this review. Recognition of fascicle somatotopy is also important in the surgical approach to disorders of peripheral nerves.},

@article{Takata.2019,
 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Median nerve cross-sectional area (CSA) is the primary sonographic parameter for assessing and diagnosing median nerve pathology, such as carpal tunnel syndrome. However, variability in the sensitivity of diagnostic thresholds exists, which may be due to a lack of standardized normative reference values. Current estimates of normal median nerve CSA stem largely from small studies using a local pool of healthy controls. A systematic review and meta-analysis will be conducted to identify all available data for median nerve CSA in healthy, asymptomatic individuals to create a comprehensive set of normative reference values.

METHODS

Articles that include sonographic measures of median nerve CSA will be identified through a rigorous search of published evidence, a hand search through tables of contents of key journals, and the gray literature, including ClinicalTrials.gov and conference abstracts. Each abstract and full text will be reviewed by multiple raters to identify studies from 2000 to present that include original data. Any study that provides median nerve CSA values from healthy individuals will be included (e.g., reference value study, control participants in a diagnostic study). Studies will be assessed for quality using a modified version of the National Institute of Health Study Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies, with primary focus on the use of a detailed and acceptable image acquisition and analysis protocol. Using data from included studies, reference values will be calculated for median nerve CSA by anatomical regions, including the distal forearm, wrist, and carpal tunnel at the level of the pisiform. Reference values will be stratified by gender, ethnicity, and age based upon the specificity of the data provided by the included articles.

DISCUSSION

A comprehensive set of normative reference values of median nerve CSA will reduce variability across studies, allowing future research to more accurately evaluate and establish diagnostic thresholds. Additionally, normative values can serve as a reference for evaluating treatment outcomes and provide a means to investigate and understand minor nuances in CSA changes that may be indicative of preclinical stages of median nerve pathology.

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

To evaluate the accuracy of inlet and outlet ultrasonography measurements for the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).

DATA SOURCES

MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched from inception to February~2017.

STUDY SELECTION

Observational studies comparing the diagnostic accuracy of inlet and outlet ultrasonography measurements were selected.

DATA EXTRACTION

Random-effects models for the diagnostic odds ratio (dOR) values computed by Moses' constant for a linear model and 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) were used to calculate the accuracy of the test. Hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curves were used to summarize overall test performance.

DATA SYNTHESIS

Twenty-eight published studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled dOR values for the diagnosis of CTS were 31.11 (95{\%} CI, 20.42-47.40) for inlet-level and 16.94 (95{\%} CI, 7.58-37.86) for outlet-level measurements. The 95{\%} confidence region for the point that summarizes overall test performance of the included studies occurred where the cutoffs ranged from 9.0 to 12.6mm2 for inlet-level measurements and from 9.5 to 10.0mm2 for outlet-level measurements.

CONCLUSIONS

Both ultrasonography measurements for the diagnosis of CTS showed sufficient accuracy for their use in clinical settings, although the overall accuracy was slightly higher for inlet-level than for outlet-level measurements. The addition of outlet and inlet measurements does not increase the accuracy for the diagnosis. Therefore, the inlet-level ultrasonography measurement appears to be an appropriate method for the diagnosis of CTS.},

@article{Velikova.2024,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

The detection and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), a vascular disorder with life-threatening consequences, is challenging due to its lack of symptoms until it reaches a critical size. Abdominal ultrasound (US) is utilized for diagnosis; however, its inherent low image quality and reliance on operator expertise make computed tomography (CT) the preferred choice for monitoring and treatment. Moreover, CT datasets have been effectively used for training deep neural networks for aorta segmentation. In this work, we demonstrate how leveraging CT labels can be used to improve segmentation in ultrasound and hence save manual annotations.

METHODS

We introduce CACTUSS: a common anatomical CT-US space that inherits properties from both CT and ultrasound modalities to produce an image in intermediate representation (IR) space. CACTUSS acts as a virtual third modality between CT and US to address the scarcity of annotated ultrasound training data. The generation of IR images is facilitated by re-parametrizing a physics-based US simulator. In CACTUSS we use IR images as training data for ultrasound segmentation, eliminating the need for manual labeling. In addition, an image-to-image translation network is employed for the model's application on real B-modes.

RESULTS

The model's performance is evaluated quantitatively for the task of aorta segmentation by comparison against a fully supervised method in terms of Dice Score and diagnostic metrics. CACTUSS outperforms the fully supervised network in segmentation and meets clinical requirements for AAA screening and diagnosis.

CONCLUSION

CACTUSS provides a promising approach to improve US segmentation accuracy by leveraging CT labels, reducing the need for manual annotations. We generate IRs that inherit properties from both modalities while preserving the anatomical structure and are optimized for the task of aorta segmentation. Future work involves integrating CACTUSS into robotic ultrasound platforms for automated screening and conducting clinical feasibility studies.},

@article{Virga.2018,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

Ultrasound acquisitions are typically affected by deformations due to the pressure applied onto the contact surface. While a certain amount of pressure is necessary to ensure good acoustic coupling and visibility of the anatomy under examination, the caused deformations hinder accurate localization and geometric analysis of anatomical structures. These complications have even greater impact in case of 3D ultrasound scans as they limit the correct reconstruction of acquired volumes.

METHODS

In this work, we propose a method to estimate and correct the induced deformation based solely on the tracked ultrasound images and information about the applied force. This is achieved by modeling estimated displacement fields of individual image sequences using the measured force information. By representing the computed displacement fields using a graph-based approach, we are able to recover a deformation-less 3D volume.

RESULTS

Validation is performed on 30 in vivo human datasets acquired using a robotic ultrasound framework. Compared to ground truth, the presented deformation correction shows errors of [Formula: see text] for an applied force of 5~N at a penetration depth of 55~mm.

CONCLUSION

The proposed technique allows for the correction of deformations induced by the transducer pressure in entire 3D ultrasound volumes. Our technique does not require biomechanical models, patient-specific assumptions or information about the tissue properties; it can be employed based on the information from readily available robotic ultrasound platforms.},

@article{Genova.2020,
 abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a common medical condition that remains one of the most frequently reported forms of median nerve compression. CTS occurs when the median nerve is squeezed or compressed as it travels through the wrist. The syndrome is characterized by pain in the hand, numbness, and tingling in the distribution of the median nerve. Risk factors for CTS include obesity, monotonous wrist activity, pregnancy, genetic heredity, and rheumatoid inflammation. The diagnosis of CTS is conducted through medical assessments and electrophysiological testing, although idiopathic CTS is the most typical method of diagnosis for patients suffering from these symptoms.~The pathophysiology of CTS involves a combination of mechanical trauma, increased pressure, and ischemic damage to the median nerve within the carpal tunnel. The diagnosis of CTS patients requires the respective medical professional to develop a case history associated with the characteristic signs of CTS. In addition, the doctor may question whether the patients use vibratory objects for their tasks, the parts of the arm where the sensations are felt, or if the patient may already have predisposing factors for CTS incidence.~During the diagnosis of CTS, it is essential to note that other conditions may also provide similar symptoms to CTS, thus requiring vigorous diagnosis to assert the medical condition of the patients.~Doctors use both non-surgical and surgical treatments when addressing CTS. Non-surgical treatments include wrist splinting, change of working position, medications, and the use of alternative non-vibrating equipment at work. On the other hand, surgical methods include open release and endoscopic surgeries.~This review of literature has provided an overview of CTS with an emphasis on anatomy, epidemiology, risk factors, pathophysiology, stages of CTS, diagnosis, and management options.},

CTR can be performed through a variety of techniques, including traditional open, mini-open, endoscopic, and CTR with ultrasound guidance (CTR-US). The evidence on endoscopic CTR is mixed, due to a higher potential for nerve injury with endoscopic CTR compared to traditional open CTR. CTR-US offers the potential advantage of allowing the visualization of all key anatomical structures, combined with a very small incision and minimal soft tissue insult. As with any ultrasonographic technique or procedure, the learning curve needs to be considered for any provider considering adopting CTR-US. However, literature on ultrasound use around the wrist, including early evidence on the learning curve of CTR-US specifically, demonstrates this skill can be learned relatively quickly by providers with a wide range of prior experience in ultrasound and CTR. Overall, there is a need for high-quality studies comparing different CTR techniques, particularly CTR-US, as it offers the potential for considerable cost savings.},

@article{DiCosmo.2022,
 abstract = {Ultrasound (US) imaging is recognized as a useful support for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome (CTS) assessment through the evaluation of median nerve morphology. However, US is still far to be systematically adopted to evaluate this common entrapment neuropathy, due to US intrinsic challenges, such as its operator dependency and the lack of standard protocols. To support sonographers, the present study proposes a fully-automatic deep learning approach to median nerve segmentation from US images. We collected and annotated a dataset of 246 images acquired in clinical practice involving 103 rheumatic patients, regardless of anatomical variants (bifid nerve, closed vessels). We developed a Mask R-CNN with two additional transposed layers at segmentation head to accurately segment the median nerve directly on transverse US images. We calculated the cross-sectional area (CSA) of the predicted median nerve. Proposed model achieved good performances both in median nerve detection and segmentation: Precision (Prec), Recall (Rec), Mean Average Precision (mAP) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) values are 0.916 $\pm$ 0.245, 0.938 $\pm$ 0.233, 0.936 $\pm$ 0.235 and 0.868 $\pm$ 0.201, respectively. The CSA values measured on true positive predictions were comparable with the sonographer manual measurements with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.918 mm2. Experimental results showed the potential of proposed model, which identified and segmented the median nerve section in normal anatomy images, while still struggling when dealing with infrequent anatomical variants. Future research will expand the dataset including a wider spectrum of normal anatomy and pathology to support sonographers in daily practice.},

 abstract = {OBJECT

Recently developed novel MR protocols called MR neurography, which feature conspicuity for nerve, have been shown to demonstrate signal change and altered median nerve configuration in patients with median nerve compression. The postoperative course following median nerve decompression can be problematic, with persistent symptoms and abnormal results on electrophysiological studies for some months, despite successful surgical decompression. The authors undertook a prospective study in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome, correlating the clinical, electrophysiological, and MR neurography findings before and 3 months after surgery.

METHODS

Thirty patients and eight control volunteers were recruited to the study. The MR neurography consisted of axial and sagittal images (TR = 2000 msec, TE = 60 msec) obtained using a temporomandibular surface coil, fat saturation, and flow suppression. Maximum intensity projection images were used to follow the median nerve through the carpal tunnel in the sagittal plane. Magnetic resonance neurography in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome demonstrated proximal swelling (p {\textless} 0.001) and high signal change in the nerve, together with increased flattening ratios (p {\textless} 0.001) and loss of nerve signal in the distal carpal tunnel (p {\textless} 0.05). Sagittal images were very effective in precisely demonstrating the site and severity of nerve compression. After surgery, division of the flexor retinaculum could be demonstrated in all cases. Changes in nerve configuration, including increased cross-sectional area, and reduced flattening ratios (p {\textless} 0.001) were seen in all patients. In many cases restoration of the T. signal intensity toward that of controls was seen in the median nerve in the distal carpal tunnel. Sagittal images were excellent in demonstrating expansion of the nerve at the site of surgical decompression.

CONCLUSIONS

In this study the authors suggest that MR neurography is an effective means of both confirming compression of the median nerve and its successful surgical decompression in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. This modality may prove useful in the assessment of unconfirmed or complex cases of carpal tunnel syndrome both before and after surgery.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND

Morphology of the carpal tunnel changes with varying wrist postures and compressive forces applied to the wrist. These changes may affect the morphology and pressure on the median nerve and could be used as part of the treatment of the carpal tunnel syndrome patients. Reliability of the ultrasonographic measurements of the median nerve has been widely studied. However, there is a lack of investigation regarding reliability of ultrasonographic measurements of the carpal tunnel.

OBJECTIVE

The purpose of this study was to assess intra-tester and inter-tester reliability of measurement of dimensions of the carpal tunnel and median nerve with ultrasound in asymptomatic volunteers.

DESIGN

A cross-sectional methodological study.

METHODS

Aspects measured were mediolateral and anteroposterior diameters, flattening ratio, circularity, perimeter and cross-section area of the carpal tunnel and median nerve.

RESULTS

Intra-tester reliability was excellent for the carpal tunnel (ICCs from 0.91 to 0.97) and for the median nerve (ICCs from 0.79 to 0.94) measurements. The flattening ratio of the median nerve showed good agreement (ICC~=~0.68). Inter-tester reliability was excellent for the carpal tunnel measurements (ICCs from 0.76 to 0.95) and, for the cross sectional area, the perimeter and mediolateral diameter of the median nerve, the ICC values were 0.89, 0.84 and 0.81, respectively.

CONCLUSION

In the context of this study, ultrasound was a reliable instrument for measuring carpal tunnel and median nerve dimensions in asymptomatic subjects.

@article{Beer.2014,
 abstract = {A critical construct related to human-robot interaction (HRI) is autonomy, which varies widely across robot platforms. Levels of robot autonomy (LORA), ranging from teleoperation to fully autonomous systems, influence the way in which humans and robots may interact with one another. Thus, there is a need to understand HRI by identifying variables that influence - and are influenced by - robot autonomy. Our overarching goal is to develop a framework for levels of robot autonomy in HRI. To reach this goal, the framework draws links between HRI and human-automation interaction, a field with a long history of studying and understanding human-related variables. The construct of autonomy is reviewed and redefined within the context of HRI. Additionally, the framework proposes a process for determining a robot's autonomy level, by categorizing autonomy along a 10-point taxonomy. The framework is intended to be treated as guidelines to determine autonomy, categorize the LORA along a qualitative taxonomy, and consider which HRI variables (e.g., acceptance, situation awareness, reliability) may be influenced by the LORA.},

@article{Gervasio.2020,
 abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most frequent entrapment neuropathy of peripheral nerves, with an incidence of 1-3 patients in 1000. CTS typically occurs between 45 and 60~years of age, and it is more frequent in women than in men. The main cause of CTS is chronic compression of the median nerve and ischemic suffering secondary to increased pressure in the carpal tunnel. There are many possible causes of CTS, which can be differentiated into idiopathic causes, which include most cases, and secondary causes. Classical CTS diagnosis is based on the patient's clinical examination and electrophysiological tests, such as electromyography and nerve conduction studies. The latter are helpful for determining the site of nerve compression, assessing its severity, monitoring the course of the disease after therapy, and excluding other causes of median nerve pain, such as cervical radiculopathies, brachial plexopathies, polyneuropathy, or other forms of mononeuropathies. However, clinical examination and electrophysiological tests are not able to differentiate idiopathic forms from secondary forms of CTS, and discrepancies are possible between clinical examination and electrophysiological tests (false negatives). Ultrasound examination is able to recognize most of the secondary forms of CTS. It can evaluate the morphological alterations of the nerve and correlate them with the severity of nerve suffering in all cases, even idiopathic ones, with a sensitivity and specificity equal to those of electrophysiological tests. It can also highlight some anatomical predisposing variants or conditions that may represent contraindications to minimally invasive treatments. Ultrasound examination also plays a fundamental role in evaluating patients with an unfavorable outcome after surgical treatment.},

@article{Bartha.2013,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

Ultrasound is prevalent in image-guided therapy as a safe, inexpensive, and widely available imaging modality. However, extensive training in interpreting ultrasound images is essential for successful procedures. An open-source ultrasound image simulator was developed to facilitate the training of ultrasound-guided spinal intervention procedures, thereby eliminating the need for an ultrasound machine from the phantom-based training environment.

METHODS

Anatomical structures and surgical tools are converted to surface meshes for data compression. Anatomical data are converted from segmented volumetric images, while the geometry of surgical tools is available as a surface mesh. The pose of the objects are either constants or coming from a pose-tracking device. Intersection points between the surface models and the ultrasound scan lines are determined with a binary space partitioning tree. The scan lines are divided into segments and filled with gray values determined by an intensity calculation accounting for material properties, reflection, and attenuation parameters defined in a configuration file. The scan lines are finally converted to a regular brightness-mode ultrasound image.

RESULTS

The simulator was tested in a tracked ultrasound imaging system, with a mock transducer tracked with an Ascension trakSTAR electromagnetic tracker, on a spine phantom. A mesh model of the spine was created from CT data. The simulated ultrasound images were generated at a speed of 50 frames per second, and a resolution of [Formula: see text] pixels, with 256 scan lines per frame, on a PC with a 3.4~GHz processor. A human subject trial was conducted to compare the learning performance of novice trainees, with real and simulated ultrasound, in the localization of facet joints of a spine phantom. With 22 participants split into two equal groups, and each participant localizing 6 facet joints, there was no statistical difference in the performance of the two groups, indicating that simulated ultrasound could indeed replace the real ultrasound in phantom-based ultrasonography training for spinal interventions.

CONCLUSIONS

The ultrasound simulator was implemented and integrated into the open-source Public Library for Ultrasound (PLUS) toolkit.},

@article{Bathala.2017,
 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

Earlier studies have shown sonographic enlargement of the ulnar nerve in patients with Hansen's neuropathy. The present study was performed to determine whether sonography or electrophysiological studies can detect the specific site of ulnar nerve pathology in leprosy.

METHODS

Eighteen patients (thirty arms) with Hansen's disease and an ulnar neuropathy of whom 66{\%} had borderline tuberculoid (BT), 27{\%} lepromatous leprosy (LL) and 7{\%} mid-borderline (BB) leprosy were included in the study. Cross-sectional area (CSA) of ulnar nerve was measured every two centimeters from wrist to medial epicondyle and from there to axilla. All patients underwent standard motor and sensory nerve conduction studies of the ulnar nerve. Thirty age and sex matched controls underwent similar ulnar nerve CSA measurements and conduction studies.

RESULTS

Ulnar nerve was clinically palpable in 19 of the 30 arms of patients. Motor and sensory nerve conduction studies of the ulnar nerve showed a reduced compound motor action potential and sensory nerve action potential amplitude in all patients. Motor Conduction Velocity (MCV) in patients were slower in comparison to controls, especially at the elbow and upper arm, but unable to exactly locate the site of the lesion. In comparison to controls the ulnar nerveCSA was larger in the whole arm in patients and quite specific the maximum enlargement was seen between nulnar sulcus and axilla, peaking at four centimeters above the sulcus.

CONCLUSIONS

A unique sonographic pattern of nerve enlargement is noted in patients with ulnar neuropathy due to Hansen's disease, while this was not the case for the technique used until now, the electrodiagnostic testing. The enlargement starts at ulnar sulcus and is maximum four centimeters above the medial epicondyle and starts reducing further along the tract. This characteristic finding can help especially in diagnosing pure neuritic type of Hansen's disease, in which skin lesions are absent, and alsoto differentiate leprosy from other neuropathies in which nerve enlargement can occur.},

@article{Baumgartner.2017,
 abstract = {Identifying and interpreting fetal standard scan planes during 2-D ultrasound mid-pregnancy examinations are highly complex tasks, which require years of training. Apart from guiding the probe to the correct location, it can be equally difficult for a non-expert to identify relevant structures within the image. Automatic image processing can provide tools to help experienced as well as inexperienced operators with these tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on convolutional neural networks, which can automatically detect 13 fetal standard views in freehand 2-D ultrasound data as well as provide a localization of the fetal structures via a bounding box. An important contribution is that the network learns to localize the target anatomy using weak supervision based on image-level labels only. The network architecture is designed to operate in real-time while providing optimal output for the localization task. We present results for real-time annotation, retrospective frame retrieval from saved videos, and localization on a very large and challenging dataset consisting of images and video recordings of full clinical anomaly screenings. We found that the proposed method achieved an average F1-score of 0.798 in a realistic classification experiment modeling real-time detection, and obtained a 90.09{\%} accuracy for retrospective frame retrieval. Moreover, an accuracy of 77.8{\%} was achieved on the localization task.},

 abstract = {Many types of medical and scientific experiments acquire raw data in the form of images. Various forms of image processing and image analysis are used to transform the raw image data into quantitative measures that are the basis of subsequent statistical analysis. In this article we describe the SimpleITK R package. SimpleITK is a simplified interface to the insight segmentation and registration toolkit (ITK). ITK is an open source C++ toolkit that has been actively developed over the past 18 years and is widely used by the medical image analysis community. SimpleITK provides packages for many interpreter environments, including R. Currently, it includes several hundred classes for image analysis including a wide range of image input and output, filtering operations, and higher level components for segmentation and registration. Using SimpleITK, development of complex combinations of image and statistical analysis procedures is feasible. This article includes several examples of computational image analysis tasks implemented using SimpleITK, including spherical marker localization, multi-modal image registration, segmentation evaluation, and cell image analysis.},

 abstract = {Automatic detection of anatomical landmarks is an important step for a wide range of applications in medical image analysis. Manual annotation of landmarks is a tedious task and prone to observer errors. In this paper, we evaluate novel deep reinforcement learning (RL) strategies to train agents that can precisely and robustly localize target landmarks in medical scans. An artificial RL agent learns to identify the optimal path to the landmark by interacting with an environment, in our case 3D images. Furthermore, we investigate the use of fixed- and multi-scale search strategies with novel hierarchical action steps in a coarse-to-fine manner. Several deep Q-network (DQN) architectures are evaluated for detecting multiple landmarks using three different medical imaging datasets: fetal head ultrasound (US), adult brain and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The performance of our agents surpasses state-of-the-art supervised and RL methods. Our experiments also show that multi-scale search strategies perform significantly better than fixed-scale agents in images with large field of view and noisy background such as in cardiac MRI. Moreover, the novel hierarchical steps can significantly speed up the searching process by a factor of 4-5 times.},

@article{Jiang.2023,
 abstract = {Ultrasound (US) is one of the most widely used modalities for clinical intervention and diagnosis due to the merits of providing non-invasive, radiation-free, and real-time images. However, free-hand US examinations are highly operator-dependent. Robotic US System (RUSS) aims at overcoming this shortcoming by offering reproducibility, while also aiming at improving dexterity, and intelligent anatomy and disease-aware imaging. In addition to enhancing diagnostic outcomes, RUSS also holds the potential to provide medical interventions for populations suffering from the shortage of experienced sonographers. In this paper, we categorize RUSS as teleoperated or autonomous. Regarding teleoperated RUSS, we summarize their technical developments, and clinical evaluations, respectively. This survey then focuses on the review of recent work on autonomous robotic US imaging. We demonstrate that machine learning and artificial intelligence present the key techniques, which enable intelligent patient and process-specific, motion and deformation-aware robotic image acquisition. We also show that the research on artificial intelligence for autonomous RUSS has directed the research community toward understanding and modeling expert sonographers' semantic reasoning and action. Here, we call this process, the recovery of the {\textquotedbl}language of sonography{\textquotedbl}. This side result of research on autonomous robotic US acquisitions could be considered as valuable and essential as the progress made in the robotic US examination itself. This article will provide both engineers and clinicians with a comprehensive understanding of RUSS by surveying underlying techniques. Additionally, we present the challenges that the scientific community needs to face in the coming years in order to achieve its ultimate goal of developing intelligent robotic sonographer colleagues. These colleagues are expected to be capable of collaborating with human sonographers in dynamic environments to enhance both diagnostic and intraoperative imaging.},

The current gold standard in diagnosing CTS and nerve damage is by electrophysiological nerve conduction study (NCS). However, 10 to 25{\%} of NCS results are falsely negative. Moreover, NCS remains an expensive and time-consuming procedure for patients. Ultrasonography serves as a real-time, well-tolerated, portable, and noninvasive tool for assessing the carpal tunnel.

@article{Kojcev.2017,
 abstract = {PURPOSE

We present the evaluation of the reproducibility of measurements performed using robotic ultrasound imaging in comparison with expert-operated sonography. Robotic imaging for interventional procedures may be a valuable contribution, but requires reproducibility for its acceptance in clinical routine. We study this by comparing repeated measurements based on robotic and expert-operated ultrasound imaging.

METHODS

Robotic ultrasound acquisition is performed in three steps under user guidance: First, the patient is observed using a 3D camera on the robot end effector, and the user selects the region of interest. This allows for automatic planning of the robot trajectory. Next, the robot executes a sweeping motion following the planned trajectory, during which the ultrasound images and tracking data are recorded. As the robot is compliant, deviations from the path are possible, for instance due to patient motion. Finally, the ultrasound slices are compounded to create a volume. Repeated acquisitions can be performed automatically by comparing the previous and current patient surface.

RESULTS

After repeated image acquisitions, the measurements based on acquisitions performed by the robotic system and expert are compared. Within our case series, the expert measured the anterior-posterior, longitudinal, transversal lengths of both of the left and right thyroid lobes on each of the 4 healthy volunteers 3 times, providing 72 measurements. Subsequently, the same procedure was performed using the robotic system resulting in a cumulative total of 144 clinically relevant measurements. Our results clearly indicated that robotic ultrasound enables more repeatable measurements.

CONCLUSIONS

A robotic ultrasound platform leads to more reproducible data, which is of crucial importance for planning and executing interventions.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE

To test the accuracy and efficacy of the multimodality imaging-compatible insertion robot with a respiratory motion calibration module designed for ablation of liver tumors in phantom and animal models. To evaluate and compare the influences of intervention experience on robot-assisted and ultrasound-controlled ablation procedures.

METHODS

Accuracy tests on rigid body/phantom model with a respiratory movement simulation device and microwave ablation tests on porcine liver tumor/rabbit liver cancer were performed with the robot we designed or with the traditional ultrasound-guidance by physicians with or without intervention experience.

RESULTS

In the accuracy tests performed by the physicians without intervention experience, the insertion accuracy and efficiency of robot-assisted group was higher than those of ultrasound-guided group with statistically significant differences. In the microwave ablation tests performed by the physicians without intervention experience, better complete ablation rate was achieved when applying the robot. In the microwave ablation tests performed by the physicians with intervention experience, there was no statistically significant difference of the insertion number and total ablation time between the robot-assisted group and the ultrasound-controlled group. The evaluation by the NASA-TLX suggested that the robot-assisted insertion and microwave ablation process performed by physicians with or without experience were more comfortable.

CONCLUSION

The multimodality imaging-compatible insertion robot with a respiratory motion calibration module designed for ablation of liver tumors could increase the insertion accuracy and ablation efficacy, and minimize the influence of the physicians' experience. The ablation procedure could be more comfortable with less stress with the application of the robot.},

 abstract = {Robotic ultrasound (US) systems have shown great potential to make US examinations easier and more accurate. Recently, various machine learning techniques have been proposed to realize automatic US image interpretation for robotic US acquisition tasks. However, obtaining large amounts of real US imaging data for training is usually expensive or even unfeasible in some clinical applications. An alternative is to build a simulator to generate synthetic US data for training, but the differences between simulated and real US images may result in poor model performance. This work presents a Sim2Real framework to efficiently learn robotic US image analysis tasks based only on simulated data for real-world deployment. A style transfer module is proposed based on unsupervised contrastive learning and used as a preprocessing step to convert the real US images into the simulation style. Thereafter, a task-relevant model is designed to combine CNNs with vision transformers to generate the task-dependent prediction with improved generalization ability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an image regression task to predict the probe position based on US images in robotic transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). Our results show that using only simulated US data and a small amount of unlabelled real data for training, our method can achieve comparable performance to semi-supervised and fully supervised learning methods. Moreover, the effectiveness of our previously proposed CT-based US image simulation method is also indirectly confirmed.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVE

When patients develop acute respiratory failure (ARF), accurately identifying the underlying etiology is essential for determining the best treatment. However, differentiating between common medical diagnoses can be challenging in clinical practice. Machine learning models could improve medical diagnosis by aiding in the diagnostic evaluation of these patients.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Machine learning models were trained to predict the common causes of ARF (pneumonia, heart failure, and/or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). Models were trained using chest radiographs and clinical data from the electronic health record (EHR) and applied to an internal and external cohort.

RESULTS

The internal cohort of 1618 patients included 508 (31{\%}) with pneumonia, 363 (22{\%}) with heart failure, and 137 (8{\%}) with COPD based on physician chart review. A model combining chest radiographs and EHR data outperformed models based on each modality alone. Models had similar or better performance compared to a randomly selected physician reviewer. For pneumonia, the combined model area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.79 (0.77-0.79), image model AUROC was 0.74 (0.72-0.75), and EHR model AUROC was 0.74 (0.70-0.76). For heart failure, combined: 0.83 (0.77-0.84), image: 0.80 (0.71-0.81), and EHR: 0.79 (0.75-0.82). For COPD, combined: AUROC = 0.88 (0.83-0.91), image: 0.83 (0.77-0.89), and EHR: 0.80 (0.76-0.84). In the external cohort, performance was consistent for heart failure and increased for COPD, but declined slightly for pneumonia.

CONCLUSIONS

Machine learning models combining chest radiographs and EHR data can accurately differentiate between common causes of ARF. Further work is needed to determine how these models could act as a diagnostic aid to clinicians in clinical settings.},

However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

 abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied to a range of challenging sequential decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: high sample complexity and brittleness to hyperparameters. Both of these challenges limit the applicability of such methods to real-world domains. In this paper, we describe Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), our recently introduced off-policy actor-critic algorithm based on the maximum entropy RL framework. In this framework, the actor aims to simultaneously maximize expected return and entropy. That is, to succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. We extend SAC to incorporate a number of modifications that accelerate training and improve stability with respect to the hyperparameters, including a constrained formulation that automatically tunes the temperature hyperparameter. We systematically evaluate SAC on a range of benchmark tasks, as well as real-world challenging tasks such as locomotion for a quadrupedal robot and robotic manipulation with a dexterous hand. With these improvements, SAC achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods in sample-efficiency and asymptotic performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving similar performance across different random seeds. These results suggest that SAC is a promising candidate for learning in real-world robotics tasks.},

 abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW

This review provides an overview of the most recent robotic ultrasound systems that have contemporary emerged over the past five years, highlighting their status and future directions. The systems are categorized based on their level of robot autonomy (LORA).

RECENT FINDINGS

Teleoperating systems show the highest level of technical maturity. Collaborative assisting and autonomous systems are still in the research phase, with a focus on ultrasound image processing and force adaptation strategies. However, missing key factors are clinical studies and appropriate safety strategies. Future research will likely focus on artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality to improve image understanding and ergonomics.

SUMMARY

A review on robotic ultrasound systems is presented in which first technical specifications are outlined. Hereafter, the literature of the past five years is subdivided into teleoperation, collaborative assistance, or autonomous systems based on LORA. Finally, future trends for robotic ultrasound systems are reviewed with a focus on artificial intelligence and virtual/augmented reality.},

@article{JENNIFERWIPPERMAN.2016,
 abstract = {Carpal tunnel syndrome, the most common entrapment neuropathy of the upper extremity, is caused by compression of the median nerve as it travels through the carpal tunnel. Classically, patients with the condition experience pain and paresthesias in the distribution of the median nerve, which includes the palmar aspect of the thumb, index and middle fingers, and radial half of the ring finger. Additional clues include positive physical examination findings, such as the flick sign, Phalen maneuver, and median nerve compression test. Although patients with typical symptoms and signs of carpal tunnel syndrome do not need additional testing, ultrasonography and electrodiagnostic studies are useful to confirm the diagnosis in atypical cases and rule out other causes. If surgical decompression is planned, electrodiagnostic studies should be obtained to determine severity and surgical prognosis. Conservative treatment may be offered initially to patients with mild to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome. Options include splinting, corticosteroids, physical therapy, therapeutic ultrasound, and yoga. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, diuretics, and vitamin B6 are not effective therapies. Local corticosteroid injection can provide relief for more than one month and delay the need for surgery at one year. Patients with severe carpal tunnel syndrome or whose symptoms have not improved after four to six months of conservative therapy should be offered surgical decompression. Endoscopic and open techniques are equally effective, but patients return to work an average of one week earlier with endoscopic repair.},

 abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the ImageNet dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than VGG nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57{\%} error on the ImageNet test set. This result won the 1st place on the ILSVRC 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on CIFAR-10 with 100 and 1000 layers.  The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28{\%} relative improvement on the COCO object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to ILSVRC {\&} COCO 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of ImageNet detection, ImageNet localization, COCO detection, and COCO segmentation.},

@article{Huang.2023,
 abstract = {Robot-assisted Medical Ultrasound Imaging Systems (RMUIS) leverage the accuracy and stability of robotic motion and offer the potential to standardize medical ultrasound imaging. RMUIS expand the scope of medical ultrasound applications and promote ultrasound in a wider range of application scenarios and imaging modalities. Compared to free-hand ultrasound, RMUIS can interpret image information more quantitatively and acquire stable images over a long period of time. This not only reduces the operator's workload, but also provides better quantitative results in elastography and 3D imaging. In addition, RMUIS can be better combined with interventional treatment, such as percutaneous biopsy, radiofrequency ablation, thrombolytic therapy, etc. However, autonomous RMUIS and other applications are still in the research phase. Insufficient interactivity, effectiveness, and safety prevent RMUIS from large-scale clinical application. There is an urgent need for intelligent learning to improve the capabilities of RMUIS. In addition, RMUIS is a multidisciplinary system of software and hardware. Hardware modifications and upgrades are also important. In this paper, we review the state of the art of RMUIS and summarize the key technical topics. In each topic, we present a variety of system composition options according to the classification of hardware. A variety of software and algorithms based on different hardware are also presented. We then present the applications of RMUIS in healthcare, showing how the capabilities of robots can be used to improve healthcare. Finally, we summarize the current challenges of RMUIS and propose future directions to explore more diverse applications and promote the practical application of RMUIS in medical scenarios.},
